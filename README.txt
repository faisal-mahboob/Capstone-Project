Description

Hi, This is my Capstone Project to my Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program. In this project i used three webAPI's to get information from each and present information  on the browser. All the API's are dependant on each other in the project. I connected them using the .then promise chain. 

The project is a Travel app. The user enters the city they are travelling to and the vacation start date and return day. I use this to find the latitude and longitude of the city using geonamesAPI. Then i use the latitude and longitude of the city to get the current or forcast weather information of the city depending on the time of vacation of the person. I then get a picture of the city using the pixabayAPI using the countryName data retrieved earlier on from the geonamesAPI. 

I used HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, Webpack(Build Tools), Service Workers (To make the page work offline) and Jest(for function tests) in this project. 

I used Visual Studio Code to write the code. You can install the Visual Studio Code here: https://code.visualstudio.com/

For the Examiner: I found the length of stay as the project addon. Allthough initially i was trying my utmost to get the country info from REST Countries API.
